# Release

Stencil can either be released by CI/CD (via GitHub Actions), or manually.
An automated release is the preferred way of creating a new release of the project.
Manual releases should only be performed when there are extenuating circumstances preventing an automated release.

## Automated Release

1. Run the [Stencil Production Release](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/actions/workflows/release-production.yml) in GitHub
   1. Run the workflow from the `main` branch, _unless_ the release is for a previous major version of Stencil.
   In that scenario, select the `v#-maintenance` branch corresponding to the version of Stencil being released.
   For example, `v3-maintenance` to release a new version of Stencil v3.
   2. Stencil follows semantic versioning. Select the appropriate version from the dropdown for this release
   3. Stencil should be published under the `latest` tag, _unless_ the release is for a previous major version of Stencil.
2. Proceed to the [Follow-Up section](#follow-up) of this document to run manual follow-up tasks

## Manual Release

‚ö†Ô∏è Manual releases should only be performed when there are extenuating circumstances that prevent an automated one from occurring ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚úçÔ∏è Authoring permissions are needed for an individual to perform a manual release. If needed, please ping Ionic leadership. ‚úçÔ∏è

1. `npm run release.prepare`
2. Check the [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) and make sure it includes all the changes that have landed since the last 
release.
3. Commit the changes - use the commit message '<emoji> v<VERSION>'. e.g. `git commit -m 'ü§¶‚Äç v2.7.0'` (note the emoji is used literally, as opposed to ':facepalm:')
4. Push the changes - `git push origin`
5. `npm run release`

# Follow-Up
1. Publish the release notes in GitHub using GitHub's [release notes form](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/releases/new).
2. Navigate to the [Stencil Site](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-site/pulls) repository and merge and PRs
   containing documentation that has been approved, but not merged that is related to the release. Such PRs should be
   labelled as `do not merge: waiting for next stencil release`. It's a good idea to review _all_ PRs though, just in
   case :wink:
3. If there are any 'next' branches in GitHub, say for a future major version of Stencil (e.g. `v5.0.0-dev`), now is a
   good time to rebase them against the `main` branch.
4. Perform the following tasks in JIRA:
   1. Mark this version of Stencil as 'released' in JIRA
   2. Move the task card in this current sprint to the 'Done' swimlane
   3. Stub out the next release and task for the release in JIRA
5. Ensure all GitHub Issues associated with stories/tasks that shipped in this version of Stencil are closed
